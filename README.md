calfix v1
=========

Fixes ICS iCalendar files for better compatibility between CalDAV servers/clients

The aim of the CalFix tool is to fix ICS/iCalendar data according to 
RFC 5545 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) as for instance exported 
from Google calendar, so that the data can be imported to 
SabreDAV-based (http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/) calendar software 
such as ownCloud (http://ownCloud.org) and can be synchronized flawlessly 
with CalDAV clients such as Apple iCal.
